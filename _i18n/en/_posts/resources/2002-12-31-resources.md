A common theme in crypto and blockchain is: Don't trust, verify!  We want you to do the same. Although we have put a lot of effort into creating the content for the Horizen Academy, we might have missed a few errors.

           It is always a good idea to consult with more than one source if you are serious about learning about a topic and blockchain is no exception.
           In this section, we have collected a number of resources,
           from great <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /resources/2002-01-01-articles %}">articles</a>
           to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /resources/2002-01-02-books %}">books</a>,
           <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /resources/2002-01-03-podcasts %}">podcasts</a>
           as well as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /resources/2002-01-04-videos-and-movies %}">documentaries and movies</a>.
        </td>
    </tr>

            While Bitcoin can support strong privacy, many ways of using it are usually not very private.
