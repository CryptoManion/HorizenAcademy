Welcome to the Technology Section of the Horizen Academy. We have created the content you will find in our Technology Section following two principles:

 - To create content for everybody, no matter how much or little you know.
 - To have a consistent structure throughout the entire content.

### Knowledge for Everybody

The content we have prepared for you is available in three difficulty levels: Beginner, Advanced, and Expert level.

<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table table-bordered table-layout-fixed">
    <thead>
        <tr class="table-active text-center">
            <th>Beginner</th>
            <th>Advanced</th>
            <th>Expert</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                If you are new to the topics of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain the Beginner Level will be for you.
            </td>
            <td>
                If you have a general understanding of what cryptocurrencies are and how blockchain works but want to know about it in more detail, we have an Advanced Level for you.
            </td>
            <td>
                If you are familiar with the technical aspects of blockchain but want to learn about specific features and are not afraid by seeing a mathematical formula or code snippet then the Expert Level will be your best choice.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="text-center">
            <td>
                Many analogies, few technical terms
                <br/><br/>
                5 - 10 min per article
            </td>
            <td>
                Technical terms are introduced
                <br/><br/>
                8 - 15 min per article
            </td>
            <td>
                Technical terms used frequently
                <br/><br/>
                10 - 20 min per article
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="/assets/img/icons/levels/beginner-2.svg" alt="Beginner" style="max-width: 50px">
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="/assets/img/icons/levels/advanced-2.svg" alt="Advanced" style="max-width: 50px">
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="/assets/img/icons/levels/expert-2.svg" alt="Expert" style="max-width: 50px">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

If you are reading an article and you feel overwhelmed, you can move down one level and read about it in a more succinct way and with less technical language. If you feel the article you are reading is not telling you anything new, move up one level and find a more in-depth explanation of the same content. Here you can find an <a href="{% tl content-overview %}#tab-technology">overview of the entire content</a> if you would like some orientation first.

### Our Structure

The general structure of our content is the same throughout all levels. You will find the same chapters from Beginner to Expert level. The higher the level, the more articles you will find in each chapter. We dedicate entire articles to concepts that we mention as side notes in the earlier levels. This allows you to toggle in between levels if you find the content to complex or too trivial.

The articles are designed so you can read them in order or individually. If you want to get the whole picture, we recommend reading from the beginning to the end. If you just care about a specific concept that you are researching feel free to read individual articles. We provide an <a href="{% tl content-overview %}#tab-technology">overview of the entire content</a> here.
