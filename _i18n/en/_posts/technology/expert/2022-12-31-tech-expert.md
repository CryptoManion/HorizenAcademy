## Coming Soon!

We designed the Zen Academy to be the go-to place for education on blockchain, cryptocurrency, and online privacy. It doesn't matter if you want to learn about the topics out of curiosity or need to learn about them because your company is exploring blockchain technology. No matter your comfort level or interest: this project is for you.

This is the Expert Section and is best for those with a good understanding of the technology, but feel they are missing some important details about how it works. 

The articles in this level take approximately 10 - 20 minutes to read and use technical terms frequently.

If you have been following our Advanced Level content, this section will look similar. We cover the same topics, but in more depth using the technical terms we introduced at the advanced level. If you start reading an article and feel overwhelmed you can go back to the [Advanced Level]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/advanced/2021-12-31-tech-advanced %}). If you want more precise information we have included links to GitHub repos, whitepapers, and other sources at the bottom of each article so you can find all the information needed to fully understand these topics.
