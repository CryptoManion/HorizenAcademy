### What a Miner Does

PoW

nonce that produces hash below threshold

![Hash Cash Style PoW](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/hash_cash_pow.jpg)

repetetive hashing in hash cash pow

some task, needs to be pseudorandom and deterministic

difficulty adjustment to keep blocktime constant

different mining algos, hash cash simple, more complex ones e.g. equihash. May also involve hashing

### How the mining algorithm is connected with the type of hash function used?

Let us take a look at the parameters of a PoW scheme, that allow us to tune it. The most intuitive parameter to understand is the target. Because cryptographic hash functions map their inputs evenly distributed across the output range, lowering the threshold a hash has to be smaller than makes the task of finding an according input more difficult. The more hash power is on the network, the lower the average time until such an input is found. This means shorter block times. Lowering the target naturally increases the block time.

There are much more complex PoW algorithms though. One of the more widely used ones is [*Equihash*](https://www.cryptolux.org/images/b/b9/Equihash.pdf), which is based on the *Generalized Birthday Problem* and used by the Horizen blockchain.

The [*birthday problem*](\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem}) describes an interesting property regarding a group of people and their birthdays. In a group of 367 people, the probability of two of those people sharing a birthday is 1, as their is one more person than days in a leap year. However, with just 23 people in the group the chance of two of them sharing a birthday is already at 50\%, while it reaches 99.9\% with just 70 people.

If you find this interesting or have a hard time believing it, you might also want to look at the closely related [*Pigeonhole Principle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) the [*Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel*](https://medium.com/i-math/hilberts-infinite-hotel-paradox-ca388533f05l) or [*The Traveling Salesman Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). Each can turn into a rabbit hole of its own.

The [*generalized birthday problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#The_generalized_birthday_problem) refers to the difficulty of calculating those probabilities in more general context. We define a time period of *d* days, and ask how many people *n* do we need to have a 50% likelihood of a birthday coincidence. Next, we can increase the number of dimensions for the problem. Instead of looking at a group of *n* people, we could look at two groups of *m* men and *w* women. With a given set of values for *d*, *m* and *w*, what is the likelihood of a man and a woman sharing a birthday.

Starting from the generalized birthday problem, David Wagner devised an algorithm - the *Wagner's Algorithm* - to compute those probabilities for even more complex setting with *k* dimensions (groups of people) and *n*-bit settings (days). The algorithm [was found to be](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06f4/507d9f584b544f96364cae2ad41e78e4035b.pdf) hard on time and space.

++++ birthday problem

The time and space complexity trade-off can be adjusted by the parameter *k*. This means, very loosely speaking, that if one uses the generalized birthday problem for a proof of work algorithm, one can make it more CPU or memory intensive for the computer depending on the number of different groups of people *k* a birthday collision is calculated for.

Horizen has implemented Equihash with *n*=200 and *k*=9.**???**

Some other examples of computationally hard problems used to create a Proof of Work include finding prime numbers and solving the traveling salesman problem. In Primecoin the PoW task is to find prime number chains e.g. *Cunningham chains* and *Bi-twin chains* where primes roughly double or follow a specific sequence. The [Cuckoo Cycle*] algorithm by Tromp et al. is based on graph theory. It comes down to the traveling salesman Problem and is implemented in Grin and æternity.

### Why do we Need Miners?

sybil resistance

what they do, how they strengthen network, how every hash operation provides a tiny bit of extra security to the network.\\

### How Mining has Professionalized


pools
"Miners like stable cash flows, hence why they join mining pools. They don’t play short term games trying to win a block, they socialize the winnings." - dan, security\\
pool operator lots of power, centralizing force
BetterHash reduces power of mining pools. Individual miners get to decide which TXs to include, not the pool operator. Decentralizing.


importance of electricity cost. highly competitive.\\

"When discussing fairness, proof of work is sometimes criticized due to the power law winners that emerge via economies of scale, but this argument is easily debunked. Large-scale mining operations operate in a highly competitive environment that ensures that coins are immediately delivered to the secondary market as they become available, as miners need to sell to replenish their liquidity. There, millions of participants have the opportunity to purchase these coins while miners are left with a small margin (or even without a margin at all in many cases). The more competitive mining is, the more it feels like coins are directly issued to the secondary market itself." - mythical fair launch\\

specialized hardware

### Hardware

CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASICs\\

why Asic resistance is a myth\\

changing algos benefits large hardware manufacturers because they have resources to develop asics for new algo first. If you keep an algo over time more companies have the chance to build hardware, decentralization again.\\

### Mining Strategies

intransparent business because highly competitive.\\

There are a few strategies that evolved which are used in order to gain a competitive advantage. Block wihtholding/selfish mining is such a strategy.\\
