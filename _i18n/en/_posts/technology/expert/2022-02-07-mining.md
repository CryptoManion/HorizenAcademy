### Intro

mining is more than just pow

its become a business and it would be wrong not to account for this. not a bad thing, but comes with certain implications.

### What a Miner Does

PoW

nonce that produces hash below threshold

![Hash Cash Style PoW](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/hash_cash_pow.jpg)

repetetive hashing in hash cash pow

some task, needs to be pseudorandom and deterministic

difficulty adjustment to keep blocktime constant

different mining algos, hash cash simple, more complex ones e.g. equihash. May also involve hashing

provides sybil resistance

what they do, how they strengthen network, how every hash operation provides a tiny bit of extra security to the network.

Block Subsidy + Transaction fees = block reward
“block reward maturation period”, and it is 99 blocks in Bitcoin


difficulty adjustment to keep block production rate approx. const.

every node can verify at any point that the chain of blocks is valid. can check if difficulty adjustment was properly done, so on, so forth

### Energy Consumption

renewable sources used more efficiently

peaks: day night, moderate temp vs hot (AC) and cold (heating) Summer in one hemisphere winter in the other (electricity doesn't travel well over very long distances)

pow is efficient

### Hardware

CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASICs

why Asic resistance is a myth

reason for asic resistance "demand" -> mining decentralization

business, centralization past peak (bitmain), more competitive. read the swaps article to get an insight into mining economics.

asic resistance usually via space complexity/memory demand
"Now the memory demand for profitably mining ETHash has increased significantly. This demand for high-bandwidth memory has prompted the development of next-generation high-speed memory tech such as GDDR6 and HMB2."

changing algos benefits large hardware manufacturers because they have resources to develop asics for new algo first. If you keep an algo over time more companies have the chance to build hardware, decentralization again.

### What is a mining algorithm?

generally: good pow criteria mentioned before: …

Let us take a look at the parameters of a PoW scheme, that allow us to tune it. The most intuitive parameter to understand is the target. Because cryptographic hash functions map their inputs evenly distributed across the output range, lowering the threshold a hash has to be smaller than makes the task of finding an according input more difficult. The more hash power is on the network, the lower the average time until such an input is found. This means shorter block times. Lowering the target naturally increases the block time.

There are much more complex PoW algorithms though. One of the more widely used ones is [*Equihash*](https://www.cryptolux.org/images/b/b9/Equihash.pdf), which is based on the *Generalized Birthday Problem* and used by the Horizen blockchain.

The [*birthday problem*](\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem}) describes an interesting property regarding a group of people and their birthdays. In a group of 367 people, the probability of two of those people sharing a birthday is 1, as their is one more person than days in a leap year. However, with just 23 people in the group the chance of two of them sharing a birthday is already at 50\%, while it reaches 99.9\% with just 70 people.

If you find this interesting or have a hard time believing it, you might also want to look at the closely related [*Pigeonhole Principle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) the [*Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel*](https://medium.com/i-math/hilberts-infinite-hotel-paradox-ca388533f05l) or [*The Traveling Salesman Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). Each can turn into a rabbit hole of its own.

The [*generalized birthday problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#The_generalized_birthday_problem) refers to the difficulty of calculating those probabilities in more general context. We define a time period of *d* days, and ask how many people *n* do we need to have a 50% likelihood of a birthday coincidence. Next, we can increase the number of dimensions for the problem. Instead of looking at a group of *n* people, we could look at two groups of *m* men and *w* women. With a given set of values for *d*, *m* and *w*, what is the likelihood of a man and a woman sharing a birthday.

Starting from the generalized birthday problem, David Wagner devised an algorithm - the *Wagner's Algorithm* - to compute those probabilities for even more complex setting with *k* dimensions (groups of people) and *n*-bit settings (days). The algorithm [was found to be](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06f4/507d9f584b544f96364cae2ad41e78e4035b.pdf) hard on time and space.

++++ birthday problem

The time and space complexity trade-off can be adjusted by the parameter *k*. This means, very loosely speaking, that if one uses the generalized birthday problem for a proof of work algorithm, one can make it more CPU or memory intensive for the computer depending on the number of different groups of people *k* a birthday collision is calculated for.

Horizen has implemented Equihash with *n*=200 and *k*=9.**???**

Some other examples of computationally hard problems used to create a Proof of Work include finding prime numbers and solving the traveling salesman problem. In Primecoin the PoW task is to find prime number chains e.g. *Cunningham chains* and *Bi-twin chains* where primes roughly double or follow a specific sequence. The [Cuckoo Cycle*] algorithm by Tromp et al. is based on graph theory. It comes down to the traveling salesman Problem and is implemented in Grin and æternity.

Prog PoW sparked curiosity https://medium.com/@ifdefelse/understanding-progpow-performance-and-tuning-d72713898db3
“Historically, proof-of-work mining has taken a fixed algorithm and modified the hardware to be ‘efficient’ at executing the algorithm. With ProgPoW, we’ve put this paradigm in reverse — we have taken hardware, and modified the algorithm to match it. “

### How the Mining Algorithm and the Hardware are related

++++ space complexity

memory hard -> space complexity

++++ time complexity

processor hard -> time complexity

Ethhash hashrate mostly depends on memory bandwidth,  high speed memory tech like [GDDR6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDDR6_SDRAM) and [HBM2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory) helps. This is at the time of writing.

### How Mining has Professionalized

pools
"Miners like stable cash flows, hence why they join mining pools. They don’t play short term games trying to win a block, they socialize the winnings." - dan, security
pool operator lots of power, centralizing force
BetterHash reduces power of mining pools. Individual miners get to decide which TXs to include, not the pool operator. Decentralizing.


importance of electricity cost. highly competitive.

"When discussing fairness, proof of work is sometimes criticized due to the power law winners that emerge via economies of scale, but this argument is easily debunked. Large-scale mining operations operate in a highly competitive environment that ensures that coins are immediately delivered to the secondary market as they become available, as miners need to sell to replenish their liquidity. There, millions of participants have the opportunity to purchase these coins while miners are left with a small margin (or even without a margin at all in many cases). The more competitive mining is, the more it feels like coins are directly issued to the secondary market itself." - mythical fair launch

### Mining Economics

OPEX vs. CAPEX

*capex* is business lingo for *capital expenditures* and *opex* for *operational expenditures*.

Capex acquisition of non-monetary capital. mining gear, racks, property (if bought)

Opex are ongoing expenditures like wages, electricity cost for the rigs as well as cooling, property (if rented)

You can go full opex or full capex - two extremes.

hashrate follows price

all else being equal, mining cost will tend towards price minus a margin
delay in trailing effects

delay in uptrend greater. taking equiptment live quicker than turning it off
exception: few miners that have bought fixed supply electricity contracts. have to keep mining

without difficulty adjustment, a given amount of hashrate would always produce a fixed amount of coins.

difference between bitcoin and gold. With gold, production will increase as prices rise. Less profitable mining sites are reactivated one the expected ROI is positive. dampens volatility as supply increases with price. With Bitcoin production is constant: 1800 btc per day

The more competitive mining is, the more it feels like coins are directly issued to the secondary market itself.



### Mining Strategies

intransparent business because highly competitive.

"We assume that miners are rational; that is, they
try to maximize their revenue, and may deviate from the protocol to do so." - selfish paper

There are a few strategies that evolved which are used in order to gain a competitive advantage. Block wihtholding/selfish mining is such a strategy.

+++++ graphic selfish mining.

usually, every node only mines and propagates the first of of two competing blocks that it sees

Why it doensn't work: higher level economic concerns: miners with significant share have a lot of tied up capital in their business, even then they operate opex heavy. Mining equiptment has to be bought. By mounting such an attack they would undermine the credibility of their source of income.. not smart.

Also to make this really feasible one would have to involve other miners and pools. High risk.

theorized about as early as 2010, didn't play out. but block withholding still done. especially when block is found very early.
