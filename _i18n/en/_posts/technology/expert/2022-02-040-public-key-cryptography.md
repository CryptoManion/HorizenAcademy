An integral part of blockchain technology is public-key cryptography (PKC). There are several PKC schemes in existence but the two most popular ones are RSA (after Rivest, Shamir and  Adleman) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). In blockchains elliptic curve cryptography is used to prove and validate ownership of data.

The inner workings of ECC are often treated as a black box and we want to shed some light on the inner workings on the type of cryptography that gave *crypto*currencies their name. To make this topic more digestible we split the topic into three parts.
