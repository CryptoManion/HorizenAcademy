This article should provide you with a general overview of what the articles in this chapter are all about and how the different topics **are related** to one another. It is a high level description not focused on details but on giving a rough picture before each topic is covered on a more granular basis.

### Hash Functions

The verification of data is an important aspect when building a data structure on a decentralized network. Participants need a way to reliably distinguish between valid data and malicious information.
Hash functions are mathematical one-way functions used to verify data in blockchains. They are applied in several important steps from creating an address, to proving ownership and verifying the integrity of the blockchain itself.
Their key properties are being irreversible one-way functions, being pseudo random in that they produce seemingly random outputs from two similar inputs, having a small likelyhood of producing the same output for two different inputs and lastly, being deterministic in that they always produce the same output from a given input.

### Public-Key Cryptography

A major building block of digital money - as the name cryptocurrency suggests - is cryptography: namely public-key cryptography. While it can be used to secure the exchange of sensitive information it is also the basis for establishing ownership in the digital realm. Without a concept of ownership digital money would be useless.
