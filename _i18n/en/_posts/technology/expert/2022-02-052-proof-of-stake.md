for POW article: PoW brilliant for a number of reasons..

- Sybil resistance
- together with the simple longest chain rule consensus in byzantine environment under asynchronous message propagation assumption.
- incentive system, rational players act honestly. best payoff. Game theory. reg BAR Fault Tolerant.
- Real world resource consumed, adds external cost, even better alignment of incentives.
