One of the great innovations introduced with blockchain was solving the Byzantine Generals Problem: coming to consensus in a setting with many unknown and potentially untrustworthy actors. *Consensus mechanisms* allow blockchains to achieve just that.
Because we want to take a detailed look at the two most researched ways of achieving consensus, we split this article into three: 

Sybil resistance mechanism?

1/ Proof-of-Work (PoW) was the first consensus mechanism that worked in a distributed environment such as a P2P network of untrusted parties. It is based on voting on a version of the history with the weight of your computing power.

2/ Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a newer, less proven consensus mechanism that still holds some promise. In PoS voting on a version of the history is tied to a different limited resource: the native currency of the protocol.

3/ There have been many more attempts to build consensus mechanisms. Some of them are highly specialized while others can be understood as slight modifications of the two previous mechanisms. We take a look at some of the proposed alternatives to PoW and PoS in this third part of the chapter.
