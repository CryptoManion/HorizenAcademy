This is the Beginner Level which gives you a high-level overview of blockchain technology.

We will bring you up to speed on the basics that make blockchains work. If you want to continue learning you should be ready for our advanced content at the end of this level.

After finishing this level, you should be able to explain to a friend what a blockchain is and what its main purpose is. You should also feel comfortable using a cryptocurrency after reading through our beginner section. 

If you find the content too trivial move up one level and read about the same concepts in more detail.

If you are interested in a particular topic you can read about it through all levels. If you want to get a general overview, read through the entire Beginner section before moving on. We designed each article to be read individually or in the context of the entire level.
