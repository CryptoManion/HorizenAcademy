We designed the Zen Academy to be the go-to place for education on blockchain, cryptocurrency, and online privacy. It doesn't matter if you are interested in learning about the topics out of curiosity or need to learn about them because your company is exploring blockchain technology. No matter your comfort level or interest: this project is for you.

We have structured the content into three levels of complexity. This is the Beginner Level. This level gives you a high-level overview of blockchain technology.

This level will bring you up to speed to be able to understand the next, more advanced level. After finishing this level, you should be able to explain to a friend what a blockchain is and what its main purpose is. You should also feel comfortable using a cryptocurrency after reading through our beginner section. If you find the content too trivial move up one level and read about the same topics in more detail.

If you are interested in a particular topic you can read about it through all levels. If you want to get a general overview, read through the entire Beginner section before moving on. We designed each article to be read individually or in the context of an entire level.
