chapter: "How does a Blockchain work?"
---

After reading our first two articles about what a blockchain is, you know that in its most simple form it's a method to store data. This method of handling data allows you to transfer value without involving a central entity. We made the comparison of blockchain being a protocol to transfer value with the internet being a protocol that enables you to transfer information. We also compared blockchain to the post being a "protocol" to send physical goods.

##### In this chapter, we want to look at how all of this works:

Miners are the bookkeepers of a blockchain. They collectively make decisions on what happened in the past, allowing the network to come to an agreement on the current state. Miners require special hardware and electricity. In turn, they receive newly created coins for the work they do. The nodes make up the infrastructure of the network itself. These two entities make up a significant part of the [elements of a blockchain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/beginner/2020-02-02-the-elements-of-a-blockchain %}).

Your public key is like your address on the blockchain and your private key is the password to access your address and the funds within. As a pair, they represent your [identity on a blockchain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/beginner/2020-02-03-identity-in-blockchain %}). The key pairs are part of an encryption scheme called public key cryptography which is one of the main pillars of blockchain technology.
