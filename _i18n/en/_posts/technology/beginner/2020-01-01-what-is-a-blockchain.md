chapter: "What is a Blockchain?"

Most people have come across the term blockchain but few can tell you what it is, let alone how it works. We will help you understand what a blockchain is and how it works. In the Beginner Level, we will focus on the main ideas and value propositions of Blockchain without getting technical about it. In this first chapter, we will look at blockchain in two different ways.

We all know that blockchain is something digital, but it helps when you make yourself aware of the fact, that blockchain is essentially another program on a computer. An important aspect is it not only running on one but on many different computers. This is what makes blockchain so robust. In the first article of this chapter, we will look at how the program stores its data, and why this makes [data on the blockchain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/beginner/2020-01-02-blockchain-as-a-data-structure %}) so secure.

If you own Cryptocurrencies, you want to be able to transfer them. Every time you send a transaction the computers on the network need to be notified so that you can not spend the same coins again. The protocol of a blockchain is a set of rules. They determine how all these computers communicate amongst each other. Because these rules are well-designed blockchain represents a great way to transfer value from one user to the other, without involving any middleman. Some people like to call blockchain [a protocol to transfer value]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/beginner/2020-01-03-a-protocol-to-transfer-value %}) for that reason.
