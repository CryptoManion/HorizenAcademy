If you have read our prior articles than you already know more about blockchain than most people. We talked about what blockchain is, how it works, and what cryptocurrency wallets do. You know that wallets are programs, that help you create transactions and receive money. In this chapter, we will introduce you to what these transactions look like and how you can take a look at them.

Here is my signature, I am the sole owner of this money and I authorize this transaction." Without becoming technical we will explain to you what this message looks like for your computer.

We will show you what kind of information you will find with a [block explorer]{% post_url /technology/beginner/2020-04-03-block-explorer-introduction %}) and what it means.
