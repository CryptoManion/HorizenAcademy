        We designed the Zen Academy to be the go-to place for education on blockchain, cryptocurrency, and online privacy. It doesn't matter if you are interested in learning about the topics out of curiosity or need to learn about them because your company is exploring blockchain technology. No matter your comfort level or interest: this project is for you.

This section is designed for Advanced users and is best for those who have a basic understanding of the technology, but which are not yet confident in their ability to apply this knowledge.

The articles in this level take approximately 10 minutes to read and introduce you to the frequently used technical terms.

If you have been following our Beginner section content, this section will look similar. We cover the same topics, but in more depth using more technical terms. If you start reading an article and feel overwhelmed you can go back to the [Beginner Level]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/beginner/2020-12-31-tech-beginner %}). If you find the content too trivial move up one level and read about the same topic in more detail in our [Expert Level]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-12-31-tech-expert %}).
