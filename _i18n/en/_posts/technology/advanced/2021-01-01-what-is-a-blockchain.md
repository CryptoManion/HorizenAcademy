chapter: "What is a Blockchain?"
---

We would like to look at blockchain from three different perspectives in the first section of our intermediate technology category.

First, from a computer scientists perspective looking at blockchain as a data structure.

Secondly, from a more philosophical perspective; reviewing the implications of blockchain technology used for value transfer.

Lastly, we discuss smart contracts, a technology that blockchain technology enables. You can summarize Smart contracts as digital contracts with guaranteed execution. You might have heard the term programmable money in the context of cryptocurrencies before. Smart contracts are the technology that enables this programmability.
