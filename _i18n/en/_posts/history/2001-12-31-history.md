We designed this section to give you an understanding of where all this is coming from, and how the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto's Whitepaper for a "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" led to us being able to put together this Academy. We go back to the emergence of strong cryptography for the general public in the first article on this topic. A group called the [Cypherpunks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /history/2001-01-01-the-cypherpunk-movement %}) were the pioneers in this domain. On the Cryptography mailing list that the group used to communicate many of the ideas used to construct Bitcoin were born.

It was the same mailing list that an unknown developer using the pseudonym [Satoshi Nakamoto]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /history/2001-01-02-satoshi-nakamoto %}) used to announce and discuss the Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2008. On January 3rd, 2009 the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain was created. The pieces of information Satoshi deliberately shared about his persona paint a picture of his motivation behind building "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".

Because the source code of Bitcoin is FOS - Free and Open Source - everybody can use the code for their own purposes. The bitcoin code served as a template for many other cryptocurrencies to follow. We discuss why such a large number of alternative coins or [altcoins]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /history/2001-01-03-altcoins %}) in our third article on the history of cryptocurrency.

For the last part of this chapter, we share with you how ZenCash started and how it evolved into [Horizen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /history/2001-01-04-from-zencash-to-horizen %}).
