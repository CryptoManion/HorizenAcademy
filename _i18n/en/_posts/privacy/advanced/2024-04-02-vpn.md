Usually, you are at risk of having the data you are sending and receiving intercepted when you are using an unsecured public network like with a Wifi hotspot in a cafe or at an airport. By using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) you can rest assured that the entire communication between your computer and the endpoint of your connection is protected. A VPN will encrypt all the data you are transmitting on your device and decrypts the data when it reaches its desired endpoint.

A VPN is a secure tunnel between two or more devices. A VPN secures your connection just like if you were using a private network. For example, many companies require their employees to use a VPN to access the private office network when they are working remotely. This ensures the data is as secure as if they were on site without the risk of data leaks.

VPNs also allow you to access services that are normally blocked in your region. You can "pretend" to be somewhere else to connect to a service not typically available in your area. Doing this allows you to connect to an endpoint that is within the area that the service you want to use is serving. If you connect to an endpoint in the United States, nobody can tell where the connection originates from. Especially people in countries with authoritarian regimes tend to limit access to the world wide web. Not only do they block certain services like streaming websites or social networks, but sometimes they also limit access to basic information that should be accessible to every person in the world.

### Choosing a VPN

Choose a VPN that is not based in one of the Fourteen Eyes jurisdictions. These jurisdictions include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US (Five Eyes) as well as a few more European countries like Germany, France, and Sweden. These jurisdictions have formed an alliance to collect and share mass surveillance data. These countries might require VPN providers in their jurisdictions to share data about their users. This extensive list of VPN providers includes information about the jurisdiction the service is operated from and a lot of additional information about the features the VPN providers offer.

Next, pick a VPN provider that doesn't require personal information to register as a user. You should not need more than an email address to use their service. Personal information also includes payment details. To maintain the highest level of privacy possible choose a VPN service which accepts cryptocurrency, cash cards or debit cards.

There are many good VPN comparisons out there and we don't want to reinvent the wheel. Below you will find three valuable resources that will help you pick a VPN that suits your needs.
