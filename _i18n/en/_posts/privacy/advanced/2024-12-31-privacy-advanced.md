We designed the Zen Academy to be the go-to place for education on online privacy, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.

It doesn't matter why you want to learn about these topics. No matter your comfort level or interest: this project is for you.

This is the Advanced Level and is best for users who have a general understanding of digital privacy and the technology that can enable you to control your digital footprint but want to know about it in more detail. 

First, we will examine the ["I've got nothing to hide" argument]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-01-01-the-nothing-to-hide-argument %}), that is frequently used when people say that a person should not worry about government surveillance if he/she has "nothing to hide."

Next, we will look at [where and how your privacy is compromised]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-02-01-where-your-privacy-is-compromised %}) on the different devices and services you are using. Most people use their phone and computer for many hours a day. The amount of data one person produces during just one day is immense. Through sophisticated data analysis, your digital behavior allows drawing powerful conclusions about your life.

The third chapter looks at two [best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-03-01-best-practices %}), that everybody should use: strong passwords and 2-Factor-Authentication or 2FA. They make it much harder for an attacker to get access to your accounts.

Lastly, we will introduce you to some advanced [tools to protect your online privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-04-01-tools-to-protect-your-privacy %}).
