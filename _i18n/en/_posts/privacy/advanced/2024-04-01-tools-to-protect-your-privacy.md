This chapter describes the necessary tools to protect your privacy. We selected tools for advanced users that provide a higher level of privacy than the tools we introduced in our beginner level. The tools in this chapter might take a little more time to set up and will come with some cost on a monthly or annual basis.

The Tools

 - [VPN or Virtual Private Network]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-04-02-vpn %}). A VPN allows you to have a secure connection, no matter if you are sitting at home or in a public place like a cafe with free and unprotected WiFi.
 - [Using Encrypted emails]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-04-03-encrypted-email %}) to communicate. You will be surprised how easy sending encrypted emails can be with the right tools at hand.
 - [Virtual phone numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-04-04-virtual-phone-number %}). You can create several different phone numbers in different countries without having to deal with multiple SIM cards and service providers.
You will find articles on more basic tools to protect your privacy in our beginner section such as [privacy-preserving browsers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-02-browser %}), [search engines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-03-search-engine %}), [ad blocker]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-04-ad-blocker %}), [encrypted messaging apps]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-05-messaging %}), and [password managers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-06-password-manager %}).

If you are already familiar with the tools in this section, we cover more sophisticated tools in our [Expert Version of this chapter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/expert/2025-12-31-privacy-expert %}).
