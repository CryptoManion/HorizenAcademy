We talked about browsers, software used to access content over the Internet in [the browser article]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-02-browser.md %}) and mentioned that there are some add-ons available that help enhance your privacy experience. Let's talk about the most notable ones:

 - Privacy Badger is available for Chrome, Opera and Firefox. This add-on inhibits tracking from advertisers. Privacy Badger also learns as you surf - if an advertiser seems to be tracking you without your permission across multiple websites, the add-on automatically blocks him from showing more content.
 - uBlock Origin is available for Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. It works similarly to a wide-spectrum blocker. It uses Origin's own filter list and lists of other similar add-ons including EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Peter Loweâ€™s ad/tracking/malware servers, and various lists of malware sites.
 - AdBlock Plus is possibly the most popular ad-blocking add-on, available for almost any browser. It blocks annoying ads, disables tracking, and blocks domains known to spread malware. AdBlock Plus has an Acceptable Ads list which displays ads that comply with the acceptable ads criteria agreed upon by the community of users. The list is maintained by Eyeo GmbH.
 - HTTPS Everywhere is available for Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. It encrypts traffic between you and many websites, essentially making your browsing more secure. Many websites still use HTTP unencrypted links inside HTTPS content. The HTTPS Everywhere extension rewrites the requests for these sites to HTTPS.

There are many add-ons available for these and other browsers to enhance your private browsing experience. Just be careful and do your own research - many add-ons might not be doing what they are advertising.
