This is the Beginner Level. This level is best for users who are new to digital privacy and the technology that can enable you to control your digital footprint.

This chapter describes the necessary tools to protect your privacy:

 - Selecting a [browser]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-02-browser %} that collects only necessary data about you is already a good step in the right direction.
 - By using a [search engine]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-03-search-engine %} you can reduce the amount of data collected about you even more significantly.
 - Ads are not just annoying, they can also contain malicious code so using an [ad blocker]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-04-ad-blocker %} is really recommended. 
 - Most people use some form of instant messaging on a daily basis. Selecting a [messaging app]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-05-messaging %} that uses strong encryption can prevent people from listening in on your private conversations. 
 - [Password managers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-04-06-password-manager %} are important tools that enable you to have complex passwords without having to remember them. Here we show you a tool that makes it easy to keep a large number of safe passwords organized.

Once you familiarize yourself with the content move up one level and read about other more advanced tools to protect your privacy.

If you are already familiar with the tools in this section, we cover more sophisticated tools in our [Advanced Version of this chapter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/advanced/2024-12-31-privacy-advanced %}.
