This chapter describes personal security best practices and provides you with a couple of tools to get started on your way to controlling your digital footprint. 

First, we will show you how to create [strong passwords]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-03-02-strong-passwords %}). There is a difference between passwords that are hard to remember and safe passwords. A password that might be hard to guess for a human being can be an easy target for a computer.

Second, we explain what 2-Factor Authentication, or [2FA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /privacy/beginner/2023-03-03-2fa-two-factor-authentication %}), is and why you should use it. Most services around blockchain and cryptocurrencies require you to set up 2FA, but many other services like Email providers offer this secure login method as well. We highly recommend everybody to use 2FA wherever possible!
