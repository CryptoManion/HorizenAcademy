One of the main engineering challenges in the blockchain space is scalability. Scalability refers to the development of technologies or protocols that can handle more transactions in a fixed amount of time. While traditional payment networks like Visa can handle thousands of transactions per second most blockchains can only handle a handful of transactions in the same period of time. 

We are working on two scaling solutions: Sidechains and a Block-DAG protocol. This article will take a look at the latter, while we have dedicated a different article to our [Sidechain development]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/expert/2028-01-03-sidechains %}).

### What is DAG

The term DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. The structure on the far left of the image below is a simple graph made up of nodes and edges connecting the nodes. In a directed graph each connection has a direction, indicated by the arrows. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) does not allow cyclic relationships of nodes like the one you can see in the bottom part of the directed graph in the middle.

### More Information Coming Soon

Because the paper describing our Block DAG protocol in detail is still going through peer-review, we cannot tell you more about our Block DAG just yet. Stay tuned for the extensive version of this article. We will publish it here as soon as we can.

There are two different ways to set up a DAG to be used for a cryptocurrency. The nodes can be comprised of individual transactions or they can be blocks containing a number of transactions. The first notable DAG protocol was IOTA's Tangle. In the Tangle, each node is made up of a transaction. Each transaction references two prior transactions and has a small Proof-of-Work (TI2.5 Consensus) attached to it. 

Horizen is considering the use of a Block-DAG protocol. Each node in the DAG is a block, similar to a block in the blockchain. It also has a block header containing important information like a timestamp and references to previous blocks as well as a set of transactions. The main difference, when compared to a block in a blockchain, is that a block in the Block-DAG can contain references to more than one predecessors. This allows the data structure (TI1.1) to become two-dimensional when compared to the one-dimensional or linear data structure of a blockchain. We only change the data structure compared to a blockchain but keep the same consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Work, to have the network agree on a single transaction history.
