        This section introduces you to the individual efforts that make up the Horizen Blockchain Platform. We discuss how our organization works, how we fund our project currently, and how we will fund our project in the future via <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/advanced/2027-01-01-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization %}">DAO</a> sustainable funding model.

We look at the two main engineering challenges we are combating. Both approaches aim to expand the capacities of our blockchain. Most blockchains can only handle a handful of transactions per second today. There are many approaches to make blockchains scale. We review our solutions to these issues.

 - [Block-DAG]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/advanced/2027-01-02-block-dag %}) structure
 - [Sidechain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/advanced/2027-01-03-sidechains %}) construction.

We also show you the first applications on our blockchain platform. 

 - [ZenChat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/advanced/2027-01-04-zenchat %}) is a messenger that allows state of the art encryption for your private conversations. ZenChat is live and integrated into our Flagship App Sphere by Horizen.
 - [Horizen VPN]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/advanced/2027-01-05-horizen-vpn %}) is our second application. It will make use of our node network, the largest node network in the industry, to offer a decentralized VPN service. Node Operators will have the opportunity to offer their nodes as an endpoint for the VPN service and earn money for providing this service. This application is not live yet, but we are working on it already.
