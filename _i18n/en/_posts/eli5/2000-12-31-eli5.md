> ELI5 - or Explain it Like I'm 5 - articles are meant to provide the shortest and easiest explanation of a topic. Using analogies and abstractions they should convince the basic idea behind a concept so that even children understand what is being talked about.


We have picked a few important concepts and technologies and broke them down as much as we could.

We formulated them as questions and answered them as if a kid had asked them:

<div class="text-center font-weight-bold">
    <p>What is a Blockchain?</p>
    <p>What is a Cryptocurrency?</p>
    <p>What is the Benefit of Cryptocurrencies?</p>
    <p>What is a Peer-to-Peer Network?</p>
    <p>What is Consensus?</p>
    <p>What is Mining?</p>
    <p>What is a Hash Function?</p>
    <p>What is Public-Key Cryptography?</p>
    <p>What is a Wallet?</p>
    <p>What is a Transaction?</p>
</div>
