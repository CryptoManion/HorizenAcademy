> ELI5 - or Explain it Like I'm 5 - articles are meant to provide the shortest and easiest explanation of a topic. Using analogies and abstractions they should convince the basic idea behind a concept so that even children understand what is being talked about.


We have picked a few important concepts and technologies and broke them down as much as we could.

We formulated them as questions and answered them as if a kid had asked them:
