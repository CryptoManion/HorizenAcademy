In a peer-to-peer network, also known as a P2P network, every participant plays the same role; they are all peers.  Each peer is both a client - it requests data from other peers, and a server - it provides data upon request from other peers. When you compare it to a regular website, this makes it a lot more robust.

A special computer on the internet stores most websites. This special computer is commonly known as a server. If you want to access the website, you connect directly to the server. If this computer happens to have a problem, the website won't work. On the other hand, with a P2P network, if one machine becomes unavailable the remaining machines continue to provide services.

In a P2P network, if you're connected to one peer and it goes offline, you are connected to another peer on the network and everything works as usual again. This makes blockchain networks very robust.

We talk about peer-to-peer networks indirectly in our [Technology Beginner section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/beginner/2020-02-02-the-elements-of-a-blockchain %}) and directly in our [Advanced Technology section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/advanced/2021-02-05-a-peer-to-peer-p2p-network %}) in case you want to know more about it.
