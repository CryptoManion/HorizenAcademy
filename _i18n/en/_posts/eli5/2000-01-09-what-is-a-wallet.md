A wallet is a program on your computer or phone, that lets you receive and send money. In order to do that, it needs access to [your keys]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /eli5/2000-01-08-what-is-public-key-cryptography %}). A wallet will help you create and manage your public and private key. An important difference to a regular wallet you are using every day is that you don't keep your money in your wallet.

Your money lives on the blockchain. In order to spend your money, you must use your private key to unlock it. A wallet is more similar to a keychain than an actual wallet in this sense.

The best way to understand how a cryptocurrency wallet works is to actually use it!

Try our newest wallet, [Sphere by Horizen](https://www.horizen.global/wallets/), if you would like to test how sending a transaction works. You can go to our [Faucet](https://getzen.cash/) where you will get a small amount of free ZEN. We have created our [Faucet](https://getzen.cash/) so that new users can try cryptocurrency out for themselves, without having to spend money or register with an exchange.

The amount you receive will be enough to create a few transactions so you can try the entire process of receiving and sending out for yourself.
