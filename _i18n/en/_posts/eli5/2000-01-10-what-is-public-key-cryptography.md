The public key is like an email address that someone uses to receive money. If a friend wants to send you some cryptocurrency you will show them your public key. Your friend uses your public key to send you some money.

The private key is like the password to your email account. It can access your money and spend it. This is similar to your email password. Anybody with the password to your email address can log into your account and send emails in your name.

It is important to protect your private keys from everyone. If they get their hands on your private keys, they can steal your money.
