    <p>
        The Horizen Academy is free and open to everyone who has the desire to learn more about these fascinating technologies. The Technology, Privacy, and Horizen topics come in three levels: Beginner, Advanced, and Expert. We designed the articles so you can read them in order or individually. The structure of our content is the same throughout all levels. The higher the level, the more articles you will find in each chapter as we introduce more concepts and look at them more closely. This allows you to toggle between levels when you feel over or underwhelmed by an article and find the content that is just right for you.
