**Topic, Chapter, or Article?**

*A clear description of what type of content you want to add and at what level of the overall structure this fits in.*

**Content**

*What concepts does the additional content cover? Why is this important? Why do you think it should be covered in a new Topic/Chapter/Article and cannot be added within the existing structure?*

**Title**

*What would you name the new Topic/Chapter/Article and where does it fit in the existing structure?*

**Substructure**

*If you are suggesting a new Topic/Chapter, what would be the substructure within?*
